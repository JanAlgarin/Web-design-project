    <div class="Biography">
        <p>I was born in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States at around the age of 8 back in 2006. 
            But even with my language barrier back then, I never really had much trouble with technology. 
            I grew up in a home where tech was all around me my grandpa built TVs mess with computers, had tons of movies tons of video games. 
            I was surrounded by tech everyday. So it was something that I always found fascinating. 
            So even after moving to the US, it didn't really hinder my desire to mess with tech.<br></p>
        <p>Now currently I've become a huge video game collector as has become one of my biggest passions 
            so while at University taking these coding classes it's been interesting to see some of the basics of what kind of stuff 
            goes on behind the stuff that I play. I'm still not exactly sure what my goals are in pursuing it but for now I am finding these 
            classes very interesting and making me feel like a kid again.<br></p>
        <p>
            My mom and sister are both teachers. I am currently a substitute teacher for Cobb County. Keeping both of these things in mind, I thought it was only natural to pursue the same career as well. I only had two semesters left to graduate but I pulled out of the teaching program because it didnt feel like it was me. That's when I approached the programming courses which I have found so fascinating.
