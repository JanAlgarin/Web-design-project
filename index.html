            <p class="main-p">I am currently a student at Kennesaw State University. My name is Jan Rivera-Algarin. I am studying Information Technology. I made this website as a project for my Web Development class. Throughout the next few weeks
                I will continue to update and add on to this website's content and functionality. All while making sure it stays responsive. This will be testing my web design skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope you enjoy what I provide here and have an easy time navigating around. <br> </p>
